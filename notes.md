misc notes

// wait for user to submit form
// function for user to submit form, or make patchGPrivates a callback
// pass the privateName, privateAge and privateYears into the function
// call/invoke the function
// with toytale lab, we were calling back a function

// fetch data from db.json
//const fetchGerbilP = fetch("http://localhost:3000/gerbilPrivates/")
// fetchGerbilP will have a promise object value
//console.log(fetchGerbilP);
// fetch returns promise, promise is object data type
/* Js uses promises to represent completion or failure
  of asynchronous operation*/
// promises have 3 states, pending, fulfilled, and rejected
//pending is initial state, determined later
// fulfilled is state that meets what the code requested
// rejected does not meet the request

/* Asynchronous programming is a way to perform
  a long-running task while other parts of the 
  program are running
