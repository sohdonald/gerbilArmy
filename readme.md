# Gerbil Army Recruit Page

The Gerbil Army needs new recruits.
Use the post and patch methods to enlist more.


 

There are 3 ranks.  Private, Corporal, and Sergent.
Make sure each recruit is placed to their proper rank.



Make cards for each gerbil recruited that shows their picture.
Create separate pages for each rank.

Create a search engine that reduces the amount of gerbils shown on the website to those
that fit the user's input.

Some Gerbils have made the ultimate sacrifice.  Move the gerbils that have been killed in combat to the memorial list.
